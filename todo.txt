To do:

- adding a transition to an existing transition
- rotate the transition labels
- add option to shorten a transition (i.e. start to first node)
- add option to make a straight transition if there is no other transition going the opposite way
- mark a state as accept state
- deselect a node after marking it as the start node.
- isolate the id "clean-up" to the controller, so that the id passed to the addNode and addLink functions isn't modified beyond its initial value.
- optimize some layout parameters (to make simple, example layouts look better) example: decrease node distance as number of links decreases.
- DFA fits all nodes in a grid
- DFA start, accept states
- position the labels closer to nodes so that they don't overlap
- different color for the last transition made
- ForceGraph clear function
- textPaths on top -- didn't work but added 0.75 opacity to make it look better
- run conversion at 1 second intervals
- possibly every other transition a different color.


- input an NFA as JSON
- rotating text actually just flips each character upside down
- transitions to delta transition table
